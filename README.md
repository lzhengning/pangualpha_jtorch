# PanGu-Alpha-GPU

 English|[中文](README-CH.md)

### Description

This project is the GPU version of [Pangu-alpha](https://git.openi.org.cn/PCL-Platform.Intelligence/PanGu-Alpha), please check the original project for the details of Pangu-alpha. The main purpose of this project is to enable Pangu-alpha models to be inferred and trained on GPU, so that more people can experience the charm of big models. The purpose of openness is to gather ideas and explore the potential applications of large model , as well as to identify problems that can guide our future innovative research and breakthroughs.


# mindspore Inference、Finetune、Pre-training
: 
1. [Please check](inference_mindspore_gpu/README.md)：This part of the code only supports inference, so if you just want to experience Pangu-Alpha, we recommend using the "Three minutes to implement inference tutorial" under this page.
2. [Please check](https://gitee.com/mindspore/models/tree/master/official/nlp/pangu_alpha  )：If you want to develop on Pangu-Alpha, we recommend using the training and inference code provided by mindspore. Model_zoo on the official website of mindspore provides inference, Finetune, and pre-training full process.

# pytorch Inference、Finetune、Pre-training

[Please check](panguAlpha_pytorch/README.md)：The full process of inference, Finetune, and pre-training of Pangu-Alpha developed based on Megatron-1.1.
