# PanGu-Alpha-GPU

 English|[中文](README.md)

### Description

This project is the GPU version of [PanGu-α](https://git.openi.org.cn/PCL-Platform.Intelligence/PanGu-Alpha). Please check the original project for the details of PanGu-α. The main purpose of this project is to enable PanGu-α models to be inferred and trained on GPU such that more people can experience the charm of the big models. The purpose of openness is to gather ideas, explore the potential applications of large model, as well as identify problems that can guide our future innovative research and breakthroughs.


# MindSpore Inference, Finetune, and Pre-training

1. [Please check](inference_mindspore_gpu/README-en.md)：This part of the code only supports inference. If you just want to try PanGu-α, we recommend to use the "Three minutes to implement inference tutorial" on this page.
2. [Please check](https://gitee.com/mindspore/models/tree/master/official/nlp/pangu_alpha  )：If you want to develop new techniques based on PanGu-α, we recommend to use the training and inference code provided by MindSpore. Model_zoo on the official website of MindSpore provides the full process of inference, finetune, and pre-training.

# PyTorch Inference, Finetune, and Pre-training

[Please check](panguAlpha_pytorch/README-en.md)：The full process of inference, finetune, and pre-training of PanGu-α developed based on Megatron-1.1.
